# Market Researcher and Car Maintenance Copilots Hackathon

After graduation, you joined a high-profile consulting company that collaborates with various industry sectors. Due to the significant demand for scalable enterprise distributed architectures, you were assigned two major projects: one with ESG and another with a highly profitable automobile company.

The ESG Department aimed to renew their legacy architecture by implementing a new enterprise distributed architecture. They sought to develop a simple interface for the new system, which would consume existing data sources and reintegrate them into the re-architected framework.
The automobile company planned to obtain state approval and needed to capture all the safety equipment within the car.
